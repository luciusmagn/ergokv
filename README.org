* ergokv

A Rust library for easy integration with TiKV, providing derive macros for automatic CRUD operations.

** Installation

Add this to your =Cargo.toml=:

#+BEGIN_SRC toml
[dependencies]
ergokv = { git = "https://github.com/luciumagn/ergokv" }
#+END_SRC

** Prerequisites

- Rust (edition 2021 or later)
- Protobuf
- GRPC
- TiKV (can be installed via TiUP)

** Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC rust
use ergokv::Store;
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
use uuid::Uuid;

#[derive(Store, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct User {
    #[key]
    id: Uuid,
    #[index]
    username: String,
    email: String,
}

// Now you can use methods like User::load(), User::save(), User::delete(), User::by_username()
#+END_SRC

** Testing

To run tests, ensure you have TiUP installed and then use:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cargo test
#+END_SRC

Tests will automatically start and stop a TiKV instance using TiUP.
